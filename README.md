# Pneumonia-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to predict whether a person has pneumonia based on chest X-ray images. Pneumonia is a prevalent respiratory infection, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. The goal is to provide a tool that aids medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Overview:

This repository contains a machine learning project for predicting pneumonia from chest X-ray images. The project utilizes a dataset of labeled images to train a model capable of distinguishing between normal and pneumonia cases.

## Introduction:

Pneumonia is a respiratory infection that requires timely diagnosis for effective treatment. This project aims to predict pneumonia cases using machine learning techniques applied to chest X-ray images. By training a model on a labeled dataset, we can automate the identification of pneumonia, assisting medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.

## Installation:

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/pneumonia-prediction.git
cd pneumonia-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

## Usage:
Once the installation is complete, you can run the prediction script:

``` python predict.py --image path/to/your/xray/image.jpg ```

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project consists of chest X-ray images labeled as normal or pneumonia. 

The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). 

There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou.

All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

For the analysis of chest x-ray images, all chest radiographs were initially screened for quality control by removing all low quality or unreadable scans. The diagnoses for the images were then graded by two expert physicians before being cleared for training the AI system. In order to account for any grading errors, the evaluation set was also checked by a third expert.

## Model Architecture:
The training script and model files are available in the model directory.

## Results:
Our model achieved [insert accuracy, precision, recall, etc. metrics] on the test set. More details can be found in the results directory.
